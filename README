This is AN EXAMPLE of "Liferay portlet" for recommendation of asset by Apache Mahout.

こちら、Apache Mahout を利用した Liferayのオススメコンテンツを表示するポートレットのサンプルです。

Liferay Version : 6.0.6
Mahout Version : Core 0.4
I tested on Tomcat 6.0.29 (Liferay bundled one)

THIS IS JUST EXAMPLE, NOT FOR PRODUCT !!!


How-to-use:

1. Import this portlet to your Plugins-sdk.
2. deploy it.
3. Create some users.
4. Log in as created user, and rate many blogs(about 10 over entry?).
5. And change the user, rating, change an usr ,and rating ...
6. Create rating data for recommendation about 50? over records.
7. If there are enough data, this portlet recommends some blogs.
8. Default recommedation target is blogs, you could change the target by 'Configuration'.

Now, this portlet uses 'PearsonCorrelationSimilarity', 'NearestNUserNeighborhood' and 'GenericUserBasedRecommender'.
Change the algorithm, and test it! ;)
